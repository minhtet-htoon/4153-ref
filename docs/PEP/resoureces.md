# PEP Resources

## Java
- [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/what-is-wpilib.html)
- [Learning](/docs/PEP/java-tutorial)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
  - [Premium Tools Activation](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) for LAPS & other participating schools.
**Not** necessary, free version works exactly the same for FRC. Use if you want to get IDEs for languages other than Java
and Python
  - [IntelliJ FRC Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9405-frc) Needed if you don't want to suffer
- [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptium.net) If for some reason WPILib doesn't come with it
