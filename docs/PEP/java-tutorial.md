# FRC Java Programming Tutorial
## What is Java

Java is a ~~verbose zombie language for writing instant legacy code~~ multi-paradigm language that is compiled to byte code 
which is interpreted by a program called a Java Runtime Environment. It is known for its ability to run cross-platform
and is the language behind popular pieces of software like Minecraft

## Pros and Cons

| Pros                                       | Cons                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Conventional, easy for veteran programmers | Steep learning curve                                              |
| Cross-platform                             | Relies on FRC community support                                   |
| Most used, lots of online resources        | You write more boilerplate than actual code                       |
| Open Source                                | Object Oriented - requires thinking about design and organization |
