# FRC LabView Programming Tutorial
## What is LabView
LabView is a graph-based purely functional language created by National Instruments for the control of scientific 
instruments and robots. It works in a way similar to Blender/UE/Unity shader graphs.

## Pros and cons

| Pros                                                                                  | Cons                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy for beginners                                                                    | Unconventional, can be confusing for experienced programmers |
| Corporate Support (vs. community on Java and C++)                                     | Windows Only (Does not run via Wine, requires VM)            |
| Hides and automatically handles boilerplate without many design considerations needed | Proprietary                                                  | 
| Decent third-party library/package management                                         | Lacks Built-in support for advanced things like swerve drive |
